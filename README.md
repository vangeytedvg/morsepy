# Morse Trainer.

A simple PyQT5 appliction to learn morse code.  It featurs sounds
and a lightbulb simulator.

The code does not yet integrate the officle WPM (Words Per Minute) nor the
Farnsworth speed.  These will be implemented later, or if you have the equivalent code, 
feel free to fork this repo.

The main application is stored in the morsetrainer.py file.

For more information about Morse code visit [Wikipedia Morse Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code)

Happy Pythoning!
